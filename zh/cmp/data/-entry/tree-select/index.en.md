Tree selection control.

## When To Use

`TreeSelect` is similar to `Select`, but the values are provided in a tree like structure.
Any data whose entries are defined in a hierarchical manner is fit to use this control. Examples of such case may include a corporate hierarchy, a directory structure, and so on.
